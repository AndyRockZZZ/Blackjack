# Blackjack

I'm building a Graphical User Interface of a card called Blackjack using Tkinter Library. It is Object-Oriented that my project include 2 classes:
1. Card
2. Players

# What I learnt

* How to display the card image by using a empty array and PhotoImage.
* How to disable buttons during game or when it is the dealer's turn.
* Using Tk.after() method to delay the loop to see the whole action like if you are playing a real game.
